.SH NAME
gcalcli \- interact with a Google Calendar
.SH SYNOPSIS
gcalcli [options] command [command args or options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
gcalcli is a Python application that allows you to access your Google Calendar(s) from a command line. It's easy to get your agenda, search for events, add new events, delete events, edit events, and even import those annoying ICS/vCal invites from Microsoft Exchange and/or other sources. Additionally, gcalcli can be used as a reminder service and execute any application you want when an event is coming up.

                             not need to be specified for this option
